scanning is 3 types
port
network
vunerable

for port n network we require
url or ip address

network:

now open firfox open website
now use command nmap website name
and for ip address
open nslookup enter website name
copy ip address
ctrl shift c
then use nmap ip...
output is generated

ctrl c to end command

to random check nmap ipadress-(randomrange = greater than specified one)

to scan the entire network
../24
(press enter to know completed %)


port scanning:

nmap -p(it is telling nmap that it is giving input as port number) portnumber IP
nmap -p 21,80,443(mutliple ports) IP
nmap -p- Ip (total)
nmap -p 21-443(range) Ip(address)

scaning is to find vunerablities

ignored states - blocked
